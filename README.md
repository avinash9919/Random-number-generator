ALGORITHM TO GENERATE RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN GIVEN RANGE THAT IS 73% BIASED TO THE HEIGHER NUMBER.
1. Take start point a, end point b and number of times in c variable.


    -------To print number between b/2 to b----- 
2. Start while loop

3. Initialize a counter i from 0 to 73% of c

4. Print random number between b/2 to b   

5. End while

    -------To print number between a to b/2 -----
6. Start while loop

7. Initialize a counter i from 0 to (c-73% of c)

8. Print random number between a to b/2   

9. End while

10. Programs ends....
